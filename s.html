<p>The goal of this project is to allow easy access to Canadian, and eventually worldwide climate data and analytics.
Please note that this project is still <i>extremely</i> young (verion 0.1), and that there will more features and data to come.
As such there may be some data that is unaccessible, this means that it was unaccessible in the original database from which it came (ie. errors on the end of the original host's database). All data is unaltered.</p>
